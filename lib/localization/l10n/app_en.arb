  "itemDetailsDescription": "Cappuccino is a beloved coffee drink that originated in Italy and is traditionally part of the Italian breakfast. The name \"cappuccino\" comes from the Capuchin friars, referencing the color of their robes. It is crafted with equal parts of espresso, steamed milk, and milk froth, making it distinctive with its rich flavor and luxurious texture. A well-made cappuccino boasts a strong espresso base and is topped with a cloud-like layer of frothy steamed milk, often artistically presented with latte art. The drink is usually sprinkled with a dash of cocoa powder or cinnamon, enhancing its deep and invigorating aroma.\n\nCappuccino has evolved and adapted with coffee culture over the years and around the world. While it remains a morning staple in Italy, in other parts of the world it is enjoyed throughout the day. The preparation of a cappuccino is considered an art form, requiring skill to achieve the perfect balance of espresso and the creamy froth. It is more than just a beverage; it's a symbol of coffee craftsmanship and culture, embodying the passion and precision that good coffee making demands. In cafes and kitchens alike, the cappuccino continues to be a central part of coffee lovers' routines, celebrated for its delightful taste and energizing effect."
